# super_sets
 A game based on the original card game Sets but with 5 rather than 3 options for each attribute resulting in prohibitively many cards for a non-virtual game.

 To play the game open index.html

 The initial prototype of this game was created in 1 hour from a blank repository by using a GPT to increase productivity.

 The initial proof of concept prototype is working.
