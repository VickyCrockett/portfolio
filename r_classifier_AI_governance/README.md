 Classifier models (edible vs not) created in R with the aim of showing how to create a model card for data governance in AI or Machine Learning.

In reality the Model Card wouldn't be a word document - for a live model with automated updates I'd advise making the report live (e.g. Power BI or Tableau or something). It would need to display the model version and a warning if accuracy was below acceptable range or if a shock was detected.
